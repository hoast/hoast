Use the following command from the root directory of the repository to run the example.

```ZSH
yarn workspace @hoast/examples run hoast-instance
```

> Underneath this will run the command line tool. See the package.json for the exact command.

### hoast-json.json

This example consists of a JSON configuration file which is picked up by the command line tool then instantiated and processed.

Use the following command from the root directory of the repository to run the example.

```ZSH
yarn workspace @hoast/examples run hoast-json
```

> Underneath this will run the command line tool. See the package.json for the exact command.

### hoast-object.js

This example creates and exports a configuration object which is picked up by the command line tool then instantiated and processed.

Use the following command from the root directory of the repository to run the example.

```ZSH
yarn workspace @hoast/examples run hoast-object
```

> Underneath this will run the command line tool. See the package.json for the exact command.

### hoast-process.js

This example creates a hoast instance and processes it without using the command line tool.

Use the following command from the root directory of the repository to run the example.

```ZSH
yarn workspace @hoast/examples run hoast-process
