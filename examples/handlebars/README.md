# Handlebars example

Create a static website using the [@hoast/process-handlebars](https://github.com/hoast/hoast/tree/main/packages/process-handlebars#readme) module. See the hoast.js file for configuration used. Run `% yarn install` and `% yarn workspace @hoast/example-handlebars run hoast` within the root directory of the monorepository to examine the output.
