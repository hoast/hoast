# Code of conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

Therefore we ask community members to be welcoming and open to newcomers, be respectful and empathetic towards others, accept and provide constructive criticism, always trying to improve the community, and apply this code of conduct both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Maintainers are responsible for further clarification of acceptable behaviour, and are expected to take appropriate actions in response to unacceptable behaviour. Therefore maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this code of conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If you see a violation of conduct or other unacceptable behaviour within our community do not hesitate and contact the project author Ron Dekker via [rondekker.nl](https://www.rondekker.nl/en-gb). The addressee will maintain confidentiality and follow up with a response in all cases. Maintainers who do not enforce the code of conduct can face repercussions as determined by other maintainers.
